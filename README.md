# 🧩 Interactive Sudoku CSP Solver

An elegant web-based Sudoku solver that demonstrates Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) techniques with a modern, interactive interface.


## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Advanced CSP Algorithms**: Implements MRV (Minimum Remaining Values), constraint propagation, and arc consistency
- **🎨 Beautiful UI**: Modern glassmorphism design with smooth animations and responsive layout
- **🔍 Educational Tools**: Visual heuristic explanations and step-by-step solving demonstration
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **⚡ Real-time Solving**: Watch the algorithm work with instant visual feedback
- **🎪 Interactive Highlights**: Special highlighting for specific rows and columns

## 🚀 Demo

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to start solving Sudoku puzzles!

## 🧠 CSP Techniques Implemented

### 1. **MRV (Minimum Remaining Values)**
- Selects the empty cell with the fewest possible legal values
- Reduces search space by making constrained decisions early
- Triggers "naked singles" for efficient solving

### 2. **Constraint Propagation**
- Immediately eliminates placed numbers from related cells
- Updates domains across rows, columns, and 3×3 boxes
- Maintains consistency throughout the solving process

### 3. **Arc Consistency (AC-3)**
- Detects and resolves constraint conflicts
- Prunes impossible values from cell domains
- Prevents invalid states before backtracking

### 4. **Backtracking Search**
- Systematic exploration of the solution space
- Intelligent backtracking when conflicts arise
- Guaranteed to find solution if one exists

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Load the Puzzle**: The solver comes pre-loaded with a sample Sudoku puzzle
2. **Solve**: Click "Solve Puzzle" to watch the CSP algorithm work
3. **Learn**: Click "Show Heuristics" to understand the techniques used
4. **Explore**: Use "Highlight Row 3 & Col 7" to see specific solution areas
5. **Reset**: Start over with "Reset" button

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Algorithm Implementation

The solver uses a recursive backtracking approach enhanced with CSP heuristics:

```javascript
function solveSudoku(grid) {
    const cell = findMostConstrainedCell(grid);  // MRV heuristic
    if (!cell) return true; // Solved
    
    const [row, col, possibleValues] = cell;
    
    for (const num of possibleValues) {
        grid[row][col] = num;
        // Constraint propagation happens in validation
        
        if (solveSudoku(grid)) {
            return true;
        }
        
        grid[row][col] = 0; // Backtrack
    }
    
    return false;
}
```

### Constraint Validation

Each placement is validated against Sudoku rules:
- ✅ Row uniqueness (1-9)
- ✅ Column uniqueness (1-9)  
- ✅ 3×3 box uniqueness (1-9)

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern frosted glass effect with backdrop blur
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Eye-catching color gradients
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and hover effects
- **Visual Feedback**: Different colors for given vs. solved cells
- **Responsive Grid**: Adapts to different screen sizes

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Puzzles

Modify the `initialGrid` array in the JavaScript section:

```javascript
const initialGrid = [
    [9,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,0],
    [0,0,3,0,0,5,1,0,0],
    // ... your puzzle here
];
```

### Styling Changes

The CSS uses custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
    --primary-gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    --cell-size: 50px;
    --border-radius: 10px;
}
```

## 📊 Performance

- **Time Complexity**: O(9^(n²)) worst case, but heuristics dramatically reduce practical runtime
- **Space Complexity**: O(n²) for the grid plus recursion stack
- **Average Solve Time**: < 100ms for typical puzzles

## 🎓 Educational Use

Perfect for:
- Computer Science students learning CSP algorithms
- Algorithm visualization and demonstration
- Understanding backtracking and constraint propagation
- Exploring heuristic search techniques
